# Workshop on Quatum Time Series Analysis
**Author:** Jacob Cybulski (ironfrown)<br/>
**Location:** Melbourne, Australia<br/>
**Date:** October 2022

Jacob Cybulski is an independent researcher in quantum computing, quantum machine learning, classical machine learning and data visualisation. He also holds the position of Honorary Associate Professor in Quantum Computing, in the School of IT at Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia.

This repository consists of examples used in the workshop on Quantum Time Series Analysis (QTSA). The workshop provides some introductory material and is delivered via online meetings (e.g. Zoom, Teams or Webex). It makes some assumptions as to the audience knowledge and skills, i.e.

- Knowledge of Python
- Basic skills in Qiskit
- Fundamentals of Quantum Computing
- Understanding of Variational Quantum Circuits
- Awareness of Quantum Neural Network techniques

The following are made available:

- [utils.py](./utils.py) - Utility classes and functions
- [qtsa_00_utils_v1.0_demo.ipynb](./qtsa_00_utils_v1.0_demo.ipynb) - Tests of support functions
- [qtsa_01_linreg_v1.6_demo.ipynb](./qtsa_01_linreg_v1.6_demo.ipynb) - Demo of quantum linear regression
- [qtsa_02_serial_model_demo_v8.9.ipynb](./qtsa_02_serial_model_demo_v8.9.ipynb) - Demo of QTSA with serial Fourier transforms
